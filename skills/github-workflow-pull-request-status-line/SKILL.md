  Whenever a PR comes up in a reply, surface it on its own line:
  `<status> <url> — **PR #<num>: <title>**` where status is one of
  🟡/🟢/🔴/🟣/⚪ reflecting live PR + check state. Also defines a
  three-line comment-block format (🔲/✅ + 🗣 + 🤖) for surfacing
  reacted-to PR comments without posting them publicly. Apply on
  every PR creation, every Monitor event, every PR citation.

# github-workflow-pull-request-status-line

Whenever the PR comes up in a reply, output its URL on its own line
in this exact format:

```
<status> <url> — **PR #<num>: <PR title>**
```

## How to load this skill

Active. Loading shapes future replies that mention a PR; nothing is
posted or emitted on load itself.

## Where the bundled script installs

This skill bundles one script, `pull-request-table.sh`. It installs in
a `scripts/` directory alongside this `SKILL.md`, so its absolute path
depends on the scope this skill was installed to:

- **User scope:** `~/.claude/skills/github-workflow-pull-request-status-line/scripts/pull-request-table.sh`
- **Project scope:** `<project-root>/.claude/skills/github-workflow-pull-request-status-line/scripts/pull-request-table.sh`

Everywhere below the script is named by its filename alone; resolve
`pull-request-table.sh` against whichever path above matches your
install before running it.

## The status line components

- **`<status>`** — colored circle reflecting live PR/check state.
  The load-bearing visual; users skim for the dot before reading
  prose:
  - 🟡 checks running, not yet merged
  - 🟢 checks passed, mergeable
  - 🔴 at least one check failed
  - 🟣 merged (matches GitHub's own merged-PR color)
  - ⚪ closed without merge, or still a draft (the bundled
    `pull-request-table.sh` folds both into ⚪ — a draft isn't ready to
    judge on check state yet, so it gets the neutral dot)
- **`PR #<num>:`** goes inside the bold span. The number is what
  users grep for when several PRs are open.
- **`<PR title>`** — the literal PR title. Wrap the whole `PR #<num>:
  <title>` in Markdown bold (`**…**`). Don't use ANSI codes
  (`\x1b[95m…\x1b[0m`) — Claude Code's Markdown renderer strips ANSI
  from agent replies, even though the terminal itself supports it.
  (Claude Code's own TUI elements like "Thinking…" bypass the Markdown
  pipeline; agent replies don't.) Bold is the reliable cross-renderer
  visual.

Example for a PR with all checks green, ready to merge:

```
🟢 https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123 — **PR #123: Document the agent PR lifecycle**
```

## A set of PRs — run the table script, don't hand-align

The status line above is for a *single* PR mentioned in prose. For a **set**
of PRs (a session summary, an audit, "list the open PRs"), do **not**
hand-format a table — by-hand alignment drifts the instant a title or repo
name is longer than you guessed, and you end up re-padding it every follow-up.
Run the bundled script instead:

```
pull-request-table.sh [--repo OWNER/REPO]... [gh pr list flags]
```

It prints one line per PR, every column padded to the widest value **in the
filtered result set**, so the table lines up regardless of which PRs match:

```
<status> <check> <repo>  #<num>  <title>  <url>
```

- `--repo` may be repeated to span repositories; every other flag is forwarded
  verbatim to `gh pr list` (`--state merged|open|all`, `--author @me`,
  `--search`, `--label`, `--limit`). With no `--repo`, the current repo is used.
- **`<status>`** uses the same circle vocabulary as the status line
  (🟣/🟢/🟡/🔴/⚪), recomputed from live PR + check state.
- **`<check>`** is the checks-status icon, colored by state: ✅ passed ·
  🟠 running · 🔴 failed · ⚫ none — folded from each PR's `statusCheckRollup`.

Example — a session's merged work across three repos:

```
pull-request-table.sh \
  --repo nhooey/skillspkgs --repo nhooey/agent-skill-flake --repo nhooey/git-skills \
  --state merged --limit 10
```

Because the widths come from the rows actually returned, narrowing the filter
(one repo, `--author @me`) tightens the table automatically — there are no
hardcoded column widths to keep in sync, which is the whole reason to prefer
the script over a hand-built table.

## Emit this every time the PR comes up

On `gh pr create`, every Monitor event, every citation by number ("PR
#9 …"), every user question about it, and before/after any operation
that changes it (push, force-push, comment, label, merge). Recompute
the status circle from live state each time — a stale 🟡 on a PR that
has actually gone red is worse than no circle. The line is cheap;
skipping it loses the user across several open PRs or hides state
transitions you reacted to in prose without resurfacing the link.

## Comment block — three lines, indented under the PR line

When you react to a PR comment (review-thread or issue-level), attach
a three-line block to the PR line. Each comment becomes its own
little checklist entry hanging off the PR:

```
<pr-line>
  🔲|✅ <comment-url>
    🗣 <author> on <path>:<line>: <comment gist>
    🤖 <one-line summary of the agent's reaction>
```

For issue-level comments not anchored to a file, drop the
`on <path>:<line>` and use `on PR #<num>`:

```
<pr-line>
  🔲|✅ <comment-url>
    🗣 <author> on PR #<num>: <comment gist>
    🤖 <reaction summary>
```

## Anatomy

- **Indent.** Comment-URL line is indented 2 spaces under the PR
  line; the 🗣 and 🤖 lines are indented 2 spaces further (4 total).
  The indent subordinates the comments visually under the PR they
  belong to.
- **🔲 / ✅** is the completeness marker: 🔲 (U+1F532 black square
  button) = outstanding / not yet addressed, ✅ (U+2705 white heavy
  check mark) = addressed. The green check on ✅ echoes 🟢 on the PR
  line, so a finished comment block reads as visually consonant with
  a mergeable PR.
- **🗣 line** (U+1F5E3 speaking head) carries who said what. Bold the
  author + location if multiple comments are stacked and they need
  disambiguation; plain text otherwise.
- **🤖 line** carries what the agent did about it. Always 🤖 — the
  point is to name the actor (the agent) consistently against the 🗣
  line above; the *what* lives in the prose after the glyph.

The comment URL is the `.html_url` field on the comment API response
(e.g. `gh api repos/.../pulls/<num>/comments` → `.[].html_url`).

This is the workaround for the agent-impersonation guardrail (see
`github-workflow-pull-request-watcher`): `gh pr review --reply` and `gh api ...
/comments/<id>/replies` post under the user's identity and the safety
layer blocks them. The comment block keeps the user in the loop
without anything getting published publicly. Emit one block per
reacted-to comment in the same reply where the underlying work is
reported.

## When to apply

- Creating a PR (output the line immediately after `gh pr create`).
- Every Monitor event from `github-workflow-pull-request-watcher`.
- Every prose citation of a PR by number.
- Before and after any operation that changes the PR (push, label,
  merge).
