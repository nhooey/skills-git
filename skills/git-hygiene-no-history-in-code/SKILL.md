# git-hygiene-no-history-in-code

Resist embedding sentences like "added in v3.2", "TODO: remove after Q4
migration", "this used to do X but we changed it" into source files.
That kind of context belongs in the commit message that introduced or
changed the code. Once it lives in source, it rots: future edits drift,
comments contradict the code, and nobody trusts them.

## How to load this skill

Passive reference. Loading it doesn't mean the user wants you to edit
code right now — just that when a "historical note" comment would be
appropriate, you'll redirect that content to the commit message
instead.

## Instead

- Put the historical context in the commit message body. `git log`,
  `git blame -w -C -C`, and `git log -L :function:file` will surface it
  later for anyone who needs it.
- If a specific line really needs a pointer, leave a short reference
  rather than the history itself: e.g., `// see commit log for
  migration context` or `// blame this line for rationale`. Then a
  reader can run `git blame <file>` on the line to find the commit and
  read its full message.

## The test

If you delete the comment, does a curious reader lose anything they
couldn't recover from `git log` / `git blame`? If no, don't write it.

## When to apply

- About to add a "historical note" comment to code.
- Reviewing existing comments that document past states.
- Cleaning up TODO comments tied to old migrations.
